# üß† Open Source Security Stack ‚Äì Modern SOC & AppSec Repository

This repository brings together **best practices**, leading open source tools, and technical recommendations for building a **fully open source**, streamlined, modern, and easily integrated security stack. The focus is on lab environments with up to **20 machines** or for initial deployment in client projects.

***

## üî• Key Differentials

- **Full Coverage:** Visibility and response for hosts, containers, network, cloud, SaaS, pipeline, artifacts, and code.
- **Intelligent Automation:** Playbook orchestration and automatic response with SOAR (Shuffle).
- **Rapid Adaptation:** Easy to expand, integrate, and adjust as the environment grows or requirements evolve.
- **Fully auditable:** 100% open source, secure, and reviewable code for audits and compliance.

## üöÄ 5. Installation & Orchestration

- **Docker Compose:** Wazuh, Osquery, Falco, Trivy, Yara, Shuffle, OpenCTI/MISP, Steampipe, ScoutSuite.
- **Security Onion:** Installation via dedicated ISO/VM.
- **AppSec:** Scanners via containers or CI/CD runners.
- **CSPM:** Scan scheduling via API/webhook.
- **CASB:** Deploy OpenCASB/Steampipe as needed.

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Start gradually:** Begin with SIEM + NIDS, log collectors, and threat intelligence.
2. **Advance detection:** Add AppSec and CSPM layers as the environment grows.
3. **Implement automation:** Adopt basic SOAR/Shuffle workflows for operational gains.
4. **Review integrations & dashboards:** Ensure all solutions exchange alerts and intelligence in real time.
5. **Automate compliance:** Use APIs and playbooks to keep compliance always accurate.
6. **Document everything:** Register configs, playbooks, and lessons for continuous evolution.
7. **Adapt for production:** As new requirements arise, add automations, integrations, and nodes.
